#CAMERA AND GALLERY ACCESSING APP
This app is created in Android Studio using Kotlin+Java.
The app allows the user to access their camera and click pictures and displays the clicked picture on screen.
It also has a feature which allows the user to access their gallery and select an image which is then displayed on the screen.
This app can be used as a backbone for any image processing projects that require images to be clicked and displayed before sending them to further processing steps.
